# Site Connectivity – Evolution Roadmap

## 1. Purpose of the Roadmap

This roadmap does not define a product plan
or a feature delivery schedule.

Its purpose is to describe the **evolutionary path**
of the Site Connectivity architecture as an
organizational capability.

The focus is on:
- Architectural maturity
- Operational scalability
- Governance refinement
- Long-term adaptability

---

## 2. Evolution as Capability, Not Features

Site Connectivity is intentionally designed
as a foundational capability.

As such, its evolution is measured not by
the number of features added,
but by improvements in:

- Predictability
- Governance clarity
- Operational efficiency
- Risk containment
- Organizational adoption

---

## 3. Phase 1: Structural Foundation

### Characteristics

At the foundational stage, organizations typically focus on:

- Establishing site-level connectivity
- Validating gateway-based trust boundaries
- Enabling basic site-to-site and site-to-cloud access
- Preserving existing LAN behavior

### Outcomes

- Reduced dependency on public exposure
- Clear separation between local operations and inter-site connectivity
- Initial validation of the site-centric model

This phase emphasizes **architectural correctness**
over scale or optimization.

## 4. Phase 2: Operational Maturity

### Characteristics

As deployments grow, attention shifts to:

- Consistent policy definition across sites
- Repeatable onboarding of new sites
- Standardized operational procedures
- Improved visibility into connectivity relationships

### Outcomes

- Lower marginal cost for adding new sites
- Reduced configuration drift
- Clearer ownership and responsibility boundaries

At this stage, Site Connectivity becomes
an operationally reliable platform
rather than an experimental solution.

## 5. Phase 3: Governance and Policy Refinement

### Characteristics

With broader adoption, governance considerations emerge:

- Formalization of trust relationships
- Explicit access review processes
- Separation between design authority and execution
- Integration with organizational change management

### Outcomes

- Improved auditability
- Reduced security ambiguity
- Alignment with compliance and regulatory requirements

Connectivity decisions transition from
ad-hoc engineering actions
to governed architectural intent.

---

## 6. Phase 4: Scalability and Federation

### Characteristics

As the number of sites increases,
the architecture must support:

- Delegated administration models
- Partial autonomy across organizational units
- Federation of independently managed site groups
- Controlled inter-domain connectivity

### Outcomes

- Scalable growth without centralized bottlenecks
- Clear boundaries between administrative domains
- Support for cross-organization collaboration

This phase enables Site Connectivity
to operate across complex organizational structures.

---

## 7. Phase 5: Integration and Abstraction

### Characteristics

At higher maturity levels,
Site Connectivity integrates with broader system concerns:

- Infrastructure lifecycle management
- Service orchestration and placement
- Observability and performance analysis
- Incident response and resilience planning

### Outcomes

- Connectivity becomes an implicit assumption,
  not an explicit concern
- Network structure aligns with system architecture
- Reduced cognitive load for application teams

The connectivity layer fades into the background,
supporting higher-level system objectives.

---

## 8. Continuous Principles Across All Phases

Regardless of maturity stage,
the following principles remain constant:

- Site-centric abstraction
- Minimal endpoint assumptions
- Explicit trust and exposure
- Incremental evolution
- Technology-agnostic design

These principles ensure
long-term relevance and adaptability.

---

## 9. What This Roadmap Is Not

This roadmap does **not**:

- Prescribe vendor solutions
- Mandate specific technologies
- Define timelines or delivery commitments
- Assume linear progression

Organizations may operate across
multiple phases simultaneously
depending on context.

---

## 10. Summary

The evolution of Site Connectivity
is a gradual transition from
structural correctness
to operational maturity
and governance clarity.

By focusing on capability growth
rather than feature accumulation,
the architecture remains resilient,
adaptable, and aligned
with long-term organizational needs.
